I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- This week we explored different themes regarding content and how display really puts the message together.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
- This week we continued to work with Hugo and GitHub, in order to really learn the uses for the different files.

I can manage content using established workflows.
- This week we didn't discuss workflows, but again, we will be rediscussing next week when we submit our first group blog post.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- We learned a lot about different themes and we were able to explore new websites like CSS Zen Garden.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- This week we picked a new theme and got it working at base level, however I needed to look further in the code in order to figure out how to change the avatar.
