<b>I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management</b>
Throughout this semester, we have had many opporutnities to define key conecepts relating to content management. Going into this class, I had no prior knowledge of what a content management system was. Throughout the last few weeks we have read many articles that define different CMS concepts. Many talked about broad concepts and nothing too specific to any certain CMS. Many definitions were given based off of Barker's definitons. 

<b>I can describe and compare content management systems</b>
I had no prior knowledge on WordPress or Hugo, however I had used GitHub in the past. This course has been very beneficial though, in order to teach me new softwares to use. I have learned much more about GitHub, including how to add new themes or modify current themes. I am still learning WordPress, but I think that has the largest learning curve of all of the technologies we are using. Hugo was easy to start using quickly and has been very fun to use throughout the last few weeks.

<b>I can manage content using established workflows</b>
I have had an overall good experience with workflows this semester. In general, establishing a workflow on Teams and creating the Kanban board has not been difficult. The difficult part anout workflows is working together in a team of six people in order to follow the schedule and tasks we set for ourselves in teams. Each week we tweak our workflow to better adjust to changing needs. We evaluate how the week prior went, and then try to make new suggestions for the follwoing week that will better serve the group as a whole when trying to accomplish our tasks.

<b>I can identify and employ technologies related to content management</b>
So far we have used Microsoft teams, WordPress, GitHub, Netlify, and Hugo. Like mentioned above, most of these technologies I had never heard of before. It was very important to have assignements such as the weekly report in Hugo and the weekly team blog post in WordPress, in order to become familiar with the technologies. 

<b>I can find and use resources for self-directed learning</b>
This semester has been challenging yet rewarding. Some of the ways to do different actions in GitHub, WordPress, Hugo, etc. have been explained to us in great detail, whereas in other instances, we needed to look up information on our own. It was very important to learn the skills to properly Google terms to find what I am looking for. It was important to find reliable sources that will have the answers to the questions I am asking.
