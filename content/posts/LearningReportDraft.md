<i>I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management</i>
Throughout this semester, we have had many opporutnities to define key conecepts relating to content management. Going into this class, I had no prior knowledge of what a content management system was.
Throughout the last few weeks we have read many articles that define different CMS concepts. Many talked about broad concepts and nothing too specific to any certain CMS. Many definitions were given based
off of Barker's definitons. 

I can describe and compare content management systems.


I can manage content using established workflows.
- I have not learned these workflows yet, but am excited to learn.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. 
- Today we set up Microsoft teams, GitHub, Netlify, and Hugo. I am just learning how to use most of these, but I am excited to get started!

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I am able to utilize Canvas as well as the internet in order to find answers for my questions.
