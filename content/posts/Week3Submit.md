I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- After reading "Content Management is an Emergent Skill". I have a more solid definition of content management, even though it is a very broad subject. Like we discussed in class, even an expert in content management has a hard time truly discussing what content management is.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
- I can describe Hugo as we have created many posts now using this tool. We are also beginning to get a strong base using Microsoft Teams.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-  This week we learned about workflows and will be using them in the future. We set up a workflow for what we think will work best within our group, but it will most likely need to be adjusted after using the workflow in practice.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- We mainly used GitHub, Microsoft Teams, and Hugo this week. I am now becoming well versed in Hugo and GitHub.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I used self-directed learning this week by learning more about Kanban. Two years ago I did an internship that followed the Kanban structure, but nothing was ever truly on a deadline there. I am excited to truly put Kanban to the test and see if it is an effective way to get work done.
