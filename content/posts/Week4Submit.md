I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- This week we explored different dimensions to CMS such as utilizing a tecnology stack and bi-directional publishing,

I can describe and compare content management systems.
- We discussed that CMS differ based on what your plans are with your CMS. Different systems will be used for different people based off of designated audience, style, etc.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-  This week we did not talk a lot about workflows, however we revisited roles within a workflow and will be using them in a project soon. 

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- As with the last few weeks the CMS we have worked with are github and Hugo, and we will be learning WordPress in the coming weeks.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I explored Hugo's capabilities this week by googling information, as well as reading content on Hugo's main page.
