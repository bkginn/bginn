I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- We were able to explain what content is using different definitions.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
- I can describe Hugo, being the first content management system we have learned about so far.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-  We have not yet learned about these workflows.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- This week we expanded our knowledge on HTML and markdown syntax while using github and Hugo.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I was resourceful many times this week while looking up syntax to further my knowledge on HTML and markdown. I have used HTML before, but markdown syntax is quite different.
