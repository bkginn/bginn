I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- This week we discussed major mistakes made by the French news station, and then discussed what parts of content management could have helped avoid that disaster.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
- This week we continued to get more familiar with WordPress and how to add plug-ins that would be beneficial for whatever social media account we would want to connect to our WP page.

I can manage content using established workflows.
- This week my team worked diligently to finish our final project early, so that we can proof read each part of the project before submitting.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- I am continuing to work with Hugo, GitHub, and WordPress.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- This week I researched new plug-ins to connect WordPress to social media, and continued to edit my walkthrough to customize your WordPress site.
