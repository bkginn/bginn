# Who am I?
Hi everyone! My name is Brittany, I am a senior majoring in ICT with a CS minor. In the picture above I am with my fiance Chris (who is a CS major) at the [sculpture garden](https://walkerart.org/visit/garden) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I have lived in several states, however spent the longest time (9 years) living in a small town in western Wisconsin. I hope to get married after we both graduate and are settled into full time jobs, so maybe 2022-2023? I am a middle child with a 16 year old brother and a 24 year old brother. 

## Interesting Facts About Me
I love fall and Halloween, so I am very excited that September is almost here. I love spending time outside and traveling (when we used to be able to do that). I am very excited that my family is getting a new French bulldog puppy named Nigel this weekend. I currently have two English bulldogs named Quincy(8) and Oscar(3). Another interesting fact is that my neighborhood is full of stray cats and I recently found a litter of kittens living in the sewer/run off drain right next to my house. I have seen 3 kittens at once so far, but I am not sure how many there actually are.

*There is a little bit about me, I hope everyone has a great semester!*
